# Monte-Carlo Techniques: Applications to the Game of Amazons by Julien Kloetzer
## Chapter 3 Monte-Carlo and the game of the Amazons

"For the Monte-Carlo method to give a good approximation of a value we need . . . it is possible to apply Monte-Carlo with a good confidence to compute a broad number of values."
(Kloetzer, 20)

Pseudo Code section can be found at (Kloetzer, 21)

I don't have much time to do more reading, but chapter 3 in this Publication looks like it might be all we'll need. I uploaded the file so that we can use it. (Logan found it, give creds where creds due)

I also found [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onBYsen2_eA&list=PLcnRBLcn6pe_ruQn-MQm9ztFLc_Jh5_if) that really breaks it down how Monte-Carlo works

[This is also another good video](https://youtu.be/lhFXKNyA0QA)
